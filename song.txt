I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge, and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
